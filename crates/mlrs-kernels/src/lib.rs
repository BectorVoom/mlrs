//! `mlrs-kernels` — generic CubeCL compute kernels, backend-feature-free.
//!
//! Every kernel here is generic over the float type (`<F: Float>`) and is
//! launched generic over the runtime (`::launch::<F, R>`). This crate MUST NOT
//! depend on any CubeCL backend runtime feature (Criterion 1); a concrete
//! runtime is chosen in `mlrs-backend`.
